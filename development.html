    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, my task was to develop an interactive interface that <b>1)</b> presents
      data in an organized format and <b>2)</b> allows users to change how the data is being presented.
    </p>

    <p>      
      To create the finalized interactive website I learned how to use React,
      a popular JavaScript library that allows for information to be passed between functions
      as components. More importantly, React provides states in which storage of information 
      can be changed based on user input.

      <h2>Part 1: Designing the Interface</h2>

      <p>
        The table below is a summary of the requirements I needed for my interface.
      </p>

      <h3>Summary of Features</h3>

      <table border = "1" align="center" width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Requirements</b></td>
          <td><b>Explanation</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Include <u>twelve</u> or more <b>item cards</b>, the visual displays of 
            data that the user is able to select and sort/filter.</td>
          <td>
            Each card will display:<br>
            <li> Item image<br> </li>
            <li> Filter categories<br> </li>
            <li> Sorting categories<br></li>

        <tr>
          <td>Have access to <u>one</u> or more <b>sorting</b> categories.</td>

            <li> By Name (A-Z) <br> </li>
            <li> By Popularity </li>

        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Include an <b>aggregator</b> to which items can be added.</td>
          <td>
            Display should include: <br>
            <li> Items added <br></li>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h3>Choosing a Theme</h3>
    <p>
      For my interface, I chose to create a book checklist. I believed a checklist
      would be a great way to incorporate all of the elements above while providing
      an easily navigbale interface for any user. <br><br>
      
      To personalize this project, I chose to display books from the 
      <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Essential_Legends_Collection" target="_blank">
        <b>Star Wars Essential Legends Collection</b>
      </a> 
      an ongoing project of book reprints 
      from the Star Wars universe.
    </p>

      <tr>
        <td>Aggregator</td>
        <td>
          <li>When the user adds a book to the "already read" list, the items displayed
          on the list will update</li> <br>
          <li>The <b>total page count</b> of books read will always be displayed on screen</li>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div id="react">
      <h2>Part 2: Implementing React</h2>
      
      <p>In my approach for implementing sorting and filtering, I decided to a mutable Set that 
      contained every applicable filter at the current state. In this matter, each state would
      only display the books whose cateories corresponded with the active filters. Using React states, 
      these goals were translated into code. </p>
     
      <p>
        The line below takes in the entire dataset of my books, aptly named bookData, as 
        the initial state. Using setState, this would be updated accordingly in functions
        written elsewhere in the code.
      </p>
      <pre class="tab">
                  <b>const [state, setState] = useState({books: bookData});</b> 
      </pre> 
      <p>
        Similarly, the line below declares an empty set representing the current state's set
        of filters. To update with setFilters, I made use of an input button within each
        book item card 
      </p>      
      <pre class="tab">
                  <b>const [filters, setFilters] = useState(new Set()); </b>
      </pre>

      <h3>Organization of Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The data (in data.js) that contains all of the information that will be displayed 
          for each book. This information is used to filter books out into different groups. <br><br>
        </li> 
        <li> 
          BookItem.js comprises my "item component". It is here that the information from data.js 
          is organized into a readable and comprehensive grid unit. A handler is passed in for each 
          BookItem such that, when the checkbox is clicked on for a book, the page count aggregator 
          gets updated and the book is added into the checklist set. <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          App.js is where the majority of the logic takes place. Here there are functions that will 
          display the sidebar of sorting and filtering options as well as the state handlers that update 
          the display of books based on what the user clicks on. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Passing Data Down</h3>
      <p>
        Within App.js, data is passed frequently between functions and handlers to update information
        instanteneously with each user input. The most notable function is the sortAndFilter function 
        which takes in several props: a book set (books), a filter set (filters), a checklist set (bRead), 
        and some booleans (nSort, aSort, checked). Passsing all of this information in at once allows me 
        to perform a series of calls to .sort and .filter, depending on what is currently 'active', 
        to then return a new set of books that will replace the current state's book set.
      </p>

      <h3>How the User Triggers State Changes</h3>
      <p>
        All changes in states occur when the user decides to check or uncheck a box. There are four 
        different assignments of checkboxes present throughout the site: 1) sorting, 2) filtering, 
        3) displaying checklist items and 4) adding/removing books to the checklist. For each of these actions, 
        I have written out some const handler that makes use of React states to update information that is 
        shared between all componentes of the App. <br><br>

        I had to ensure that books that had been checked would remain checked even if a filter 
        caused the book to disappear from display. This was the foundation for my boolean state 
        structure in which I use the onChange event of the checkboxes to update booleans representing 
        what filters/sorts are triggered. This made it easy to then call a sort and filter function 
        without encountering conflicts of what was and wasn't checked. <br><br>

        One last important state change is the handleReset const that I represent as a button on the screen. 
        This triggers all the useState declarations I have such that we return to the original state of the site. 
        This also triggers a forEach loop on all of the 'checked' booleans of the checkboxes to return to false 
        so nothing is checked once reset.
