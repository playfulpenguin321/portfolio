    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, my goals were to select any user interface to study, to interview people on their
      experience with said interface and lastly to represent an analysis and critique of the interface
      via empathy maps and a storyboard. <br> 
      I chose a kiosk for a boba shop near Brown University, which is frequented by many students 
      as well as other demographics. With the collected information of several testers, I was able to 
      construct two empathy maps that portray two distinct personas based on the experiences of these testers.

        <ol>
          <li>
            When users tap on the search bar, a large keyboard will display. Results from any category 
            will display on screen if any item containing the userâ€™s key words exists.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tapping on any of these headings will move the menu to the specified category.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tapping on an item will open a new screen, allowing the user to select additional toppings, 
            add to cart, and/or make final payments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can scroll down using the touch screen to view menu.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Users can navigate back to main menu at any point.

      <h2>Part 2: Observations</h2>

      <p>To gain feedback from user interactions, I prepared a series of questions
        to ask to the participants. 
      </p>

      <div class="info-block">
      <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
      <p>Users were asked the following questions after finishing their order: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Were you comfortable starting your order on this interface?
        </li>
        <li>
          Were you able to read and interpret information clearly on this interface?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did you have trouble making selections at any point in this experience? 
        </li>
        <li>
          What interactions with similar interfaces helped you for this experience?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you have any suggestions to improve your experience?
        </li>
      </ol>
      </div>

      <h3 style="margin-left: 50px">Summarized Responses</h3>

      <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 50px">
        <li>
          Although not every user had been to this specific kiosk, all users said they were comfortable
          using the touchscreen to begin looking at the menu. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
          There were a few instances where users were unaware of certain features, namely
          the restart feature on the main menu, but this was an oversight that did not affect the 
          experience negatively and information was read clearly overall.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          Answers varied for making selections, varying from there being no struggles, to some 
          desiring less empty space on the selection page, to some being confused on navigating
          backward rather than forward [tapping/scrolling was not itself an issue].
        </li><br>
        <li>
          Every user cited their phones, tablets and/or other store kiosks as their reference points for 
          this kiosk.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          Suggestions included more visual aids for clarity and more description on the specifics
          of ingredients and more.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-left: 40px"> 
        Persona 1: (Confident) Caleb - An upperclassman who regularly goes out to shop around college campus.
      </h3>
      <p>
        As someone who has had experiences at other shops, Caleb is comfortable using the kiosk in whatever
        manner he desires.
        However, the kiosk interface still lacks some specific features that would improve ordering
        even further for him, such as warnings for specific ingredients and a dairy-free section.
      </p><p>
        Caleb represents how most users responded well with their kiosk experience. While these users 
        had no issue with navigation, the suggestions mentioned in "Key Observations" are more likely
        to be related with an experienced persona such as Caleb. Health details on each drink and
        a better representation of SnackPass points are among these potential improvements.

        Persona 2: (Awkward) Amanda - A freshman who is getting to know places on campus for the first time.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Amanda is able to understand how to use the kiosk, but still has a few missteps in her
        experience. She had hoped to see more than just a finished picture of her drink and was not
        confident in the toppings she chose. Despite this she completes the order and now knows what 
        to do if she comes another time. 
      </p><p>
        I based Amanda on the two users I interviewed who I knew had not been to this store. 
        The issues they had are not major but are worth pointing out for a smoother first-time experience.
        It would be good to have a more noticeable indicator on the screen on how to undo and/or reset 
        the current choices. Some users may also struggle if they rely on visual indicators, as opposed to 
        the heavy presence of text past the main menu.
